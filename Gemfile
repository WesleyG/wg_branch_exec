# WGG 5/27/2014 from Darby:
# Not sure how critical the calculation is, but Ruby is a tad 
# problematic with floating point math. There is a gem called 
# money that pretty much everyone uses when dealing with money 
# calculations: https://github.com/RubyMoney/money. It stores 
# the the value as an integer in cents. so instead of 10.00 
# it would store 1000. That makes it easier to do math with. 
# It also supports currency conversation. Not sure how 
# important this number is, but if you think youâ€™ll be 
# dealing with fractions of a dollar, I would recommend 
# using this gem
